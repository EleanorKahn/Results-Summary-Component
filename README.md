## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwindcss 

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
This was my first time using custom colors and fonts alongside tailwindcss. Overall, it was a really good opportunity to practice using tailwindcss, as I am still not as familiar with it as I would like. 

### Continued development

I am still not as comfortable with CSS layout as I would like. Specifically, when do I use certain layouts or tools vs others.
